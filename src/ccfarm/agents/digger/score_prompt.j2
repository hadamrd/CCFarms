This is a preliminary assessment based only on the title and description. Consider that truly comedy-worthy content (scoring 7+) should be rare and exceptional.

Scoring guidelines:
- Higher scores (7-10): Reserve for articles with universal appeal, unexpected juxtapositions, ironic situations, or inherent absurdity
- Consider giving higher scores to stories involving:
  • Well-known public figures, celebrities, or recognizable brands
  • Catchy, attention-grabbing headlines with broad relatability
  • Subject matter accessible to general audiences without specialized knowledge
  • Situations with inherent irony, contradiction, or unexpected outcomes
  • Topics that connect to ongoing cultural conversations or zeitgeist

Be extremely selective. A score of 7+ indicates exceptional comedy potential that would resonate with a broad audience.
