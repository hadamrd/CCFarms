# Input Articles:

{{ loop.index }}. Title: {{ article.title }}
  Content: {{ article.content }}
{% endfor %}

# Script Requirements:
- **Title:** Create a catchy, satirical title reflecting the combined news stories.
- **Segments:**
  - **Intro Segment:** Use the exact text: "Hello guys, this is TechSass, and in today’s video, we’re diving into the wild world of tech with a twist of sass. <this message should be adapted to the articles vibes>"
  - **Main Segments (3-5):** Generate 3-5 segments blending info from the articles. Each segment should have:
    - **Text:** 2-3 sentences in your nerdy, sarcastic style with humor, exaggeration and absurdity. Add SSML tags (<emphasis>, <prosody>, <break>) for comedic timing and delivery.
    - **Keywords:** specific and visually representable keywords (e.g., "drone", "explosion", "confused" ... ) for fetching GIFs/images.
  - **Outro Segment:** Use the exact text: "And that’s a wrap, folks! If you enjoyed this dose of tech sass, hit that subscribe button to stay tuned. <here insert something funny>"

# Notes:
- Keep it hilarious, tech-focused, and true to the articles.
- Use keywords that fetch great visuals (specific nouns/actions/emotions, not vague terms).
- Weave a loose theme or gag across segments for cohesion.
- Make it sound natural, like you’re riffing live!.
