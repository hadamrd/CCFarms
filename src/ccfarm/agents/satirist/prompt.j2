You are writing today's comedy script for a satirical news program based on the following analyzed news articles:

{% for brief in briefs %}
----- ARTICLE {{ loop.index }} -----
{{ brief | tojson }}

{% endfor %}

Today's date is {{ date }}.

Create a satirical comedy segment that makes fun of these news stories in a witty, clever way. Focus on the most comedically promising stories (higher comedy_potential scores).

For the body, create a complete script that includes:
- An opening monologue to set the tone and introduce key stories
- Multiple segments with humorous takes on the news stories
- Closing remarks that wrap up the show with a final punchline

Format the body with proper markdown for readability:
- Use headings (# for title, ## for segments)
- Consider using *italics* for emphasis or to indicate tone shifts
- Format jokes with clear setups and punchlines
- You can use > blockquotes for special segments or "on-screen graphics"

Remember:
- Be creative and funny while maintaining balanced political perspective
- Use humor techniques like exaggeration, irony, and unexpected connections
- Ensure jokes are amusing without being overly cruel
- Find unexpected connections between different stories when possible
