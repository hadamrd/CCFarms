I need you to create a comedy script for our satirical news show based on today's analyzed news stories. 

Today is {{ date }}.

Here are the analyzed briefs from our news team:

{% for brief in briefs %}
ARTICLE {{ loop.index }}:
Title: {{ brief.title }}
URL: {{ brief.url }}
{% if brief.brief.comedy_potential %}
Comedy Potential Score: {{ brief.brief.comedy_potential.overall_score }}
Comedy Reasons: {{ brief.brief.comedy_potential.reasons }}
{% endif %}
{% if brief.brief.core_story %}
Summary: {{ brief.brief.core_story.simple_summary }}
Key Elements: {{ brief.brief.core_story.key_elements }}
{% endif %}
{% if brief.brief.absurdity_analysis %}
Absurd Elements: {{ brief.brief.absurdity_analysis.absurd_elements }}
Exaggeration Potential: {{ brief.brief.absurdity_analysis.exaggeration_potential }}
{% endif %}
{% if brief.brief.cultural_relevance %}
References: {{ brief.brief.cultural_relevance.references }}
Topicality: {{ brief.brief.cultural_relevance.topicality }}
{% endif %}
{% if brief.brief.target_analysis %}
Primary Targets: {{ brief.brief.target_analysis.primary_targets }}
Target Type: {{ brief.brief.target_analysis.target_type }}
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}

Please craft a comedy script for a 10-15 minute segment combining the best material from these stories. Focus on the articles with the highest comedy potential scores and look for unexpected connections between stories.

Your response must follow the format described in your instructions, returning properly formatted JSON wrapped in <comedy_script> tags.

I need a witty title, an opening monologue to set the tone, individual comedy segments for the most promising stories, and a brief closing with a final punchline. Each segment should include headline jokes and short sketch ideas where appropriate.

Be creative, irreverent, but tasteful. Good luck!
